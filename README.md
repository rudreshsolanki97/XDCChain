# XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) Consensus

Self KYC compliant Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) Consensus on XDC Blockchain

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, efficient, decentralized, and flexible consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. Self KYC feature adds more enterpise usecases and regulator friendliness to the Public network.

This document describes the specification for a XinFin DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) network.

Voting

Any network participant will be able to vote for eligible Validators.

    Staking

    Users can stake their coins by sending them to the deposit function on the staking contract.
        The staked amount must be larger than an amount MIN_STAKE
        The user will have to wait for 2 epochs (epoch N+2) before being able to vote for a delegate.
    Delegating
        After 2 epochs, a Nominator can vote for a Validator with the staked coins.
        The vote will be effective in the epoch N+2, N being the current epoch.
        A new vote can be casted every 2 epochs.
        In this version, the entire stake must be voted to a single Validator. If a user wants to delegate to multiple Validators they can split their stake amongst several accounts which can then individually register as Nominators.
    Withdrawal

    Nominators should be able to withdraw their stake.
        First they must call delegate to remove their vote.
        After a specified number of epochs WITHDRAWAL_PERIOD the funds are unlocked and withdraw function on the smart contract can be called with a withdrawal address.

Validators Registration

Any network participant will be able to register as a Validator.

    A specified value REGISTRATION_VALUE (in the native token) will be sent to a register function on the contract. It will be staked in order to limit the number of participants.
    Validator is required to add KYC document at the time of staking XDC token.
    A hard limit to the total number of registered Validators MAX_REGISTERED_VALIDATORS should be specified.
    Any Validator registering will have to wait for the beginning of epoch N+2 (current epoch being N) to be eligible.
    A Validator's total stake must be greater than the MIN_TOTAL_STAKE in order for it to be eligible.
    The top validators (by a total stake) in a given epoch are chosen as the active Validator Set: those Validators that produce blocks in the next epoch.

KYC:

Masternode Holder need to Add Know your customer (KYC) identification as its falls under the responsibility of financial institution and/or regulated company. Validator needs to upload self KYC document and this document will be visible on open public network.

Choosing Validators

choose L Validators for a certain epoch N

    Balanced staked

    This version of the DPoS contract should balance all the stakes by finding the minimum staked for all eligible Validators (eg. take the top 1000 Validators) and balance all the Validators stakes by refunding the users the contributions that overflowed the stake.

    For example, if the minimum stake is S, we want to balance all stakes to S. If a Validator has S+100 stakes because of 3 contributions: Sâˆ’10, 5 and 100, then the last nominator will be refunded 95.

    In this model, an epoch would be of the maximum number of Validators allowed, eg. 1,001 (+/- an hour on a 4-seconds block time chain).

Rewards

Rewards are assigned via the Rewards Contract.

    Rewards for active Validators are calculated as a percentage of total stake, VALIDATOR_REWARD.
    Nominators would also need to be rewarded to incentivize them to stake. There are a couple of options here:
        The reward contract pays directly out to nominators, minus a fee payed the Validator, which could be specified when registering.
        The Validator is responsible for calculating/paying out the rewards. This could be done by allowing the Validators to register their own Reward Contract when registering.

Fork Perversion, Malicious or Double Spends:

To Prevent fork, we like to add feature to re-validate transaction. Every transaction will have 2 signatures. one signature will be by block creator and second signature will be by block verifier (both separate validator). So, block verifier will check for malicious or double spends etc.

Slashing

In order for the network to be secure, misbehaviours must be detected and punished.

    Off-chain

    Off-chain detection of misbehaviour is easier to implement and can be used for tricky misbehaviour detections. In the contract, there will be a reportBenign method (part of the Validator Set Contract) that only Validators can call, passing a message and a block-number, and a slashing will execute if more than 2/3 of the Validators agree on the misbehaviour.

    These might include but are not limited to:
        Validators consistently propagating blocks late
        Validators being offline for more than 24 hours

    It could slash a portion of the stakes, eg. only 4%
    On-chain

    A slashing condition that can be verified on-chain is that a Validator signed-off 2 blocks with the same step (equivocation). Anyone could call this reportMalicious method with the right data, being the two signatures of the Validator, and the message signed, which would contain the step of the blocks.

    This method would thus include an RLP decoder. We could also detect if a Validator hasn't signed any block for the past 256 blocks on-chain, by challenging the Validator to submit the block he signed along with the signature. However, only the last 256 block hashes are available in the EVM, so it might be limited in this context of around 1,000-blocks epochs.
        Wrong KYC Detail Enter by Validator Node
        In the contract, there will be a reportMalicious method that only Validators can call, passing a message and a block-number, and a slashing will execute if more than 2/3 of the Validators agree on the reportMalicious. It could slash a portion of the Entire 100% stakes of Validator Node.

    There may be other on-chain slashable conditions.

Parameters

Suggested parameter values from requirements:

MIN_STAKE : 10,000,000 XDC

VALIDATOR_REWARD : 0.01370% Daily

REWARDS_TRANSFER : Every next block of epoch

VALIDATOR_SET_SIZE : 18-21

WITHDRAWAL_PERIOD : Set of Epoch (1 Epoch == 500 Blocks)

MAX_REGISTERED_VALIDATORS : 5000

Upgradability

Contracts should be upgradeable, could be implemented with Proxy contracts.

Governance mechanism : In the contract, there will be a Vote method (part of the Validator Set Contract) that only Validators can call, passing a message and a Change function will be execute if more than 2/3 of the Validators agree on the Upgrade.

Contract state would need to be transferred to the new version of the contract, either through a migration process or a persistent storage pattern.
